# Why?

I mean, why not? But why?

## v.1

This one will be a bit jagged since I don't know what I'm doing, but nonetheless, my main angles on why this is worth doing as a sort of research-creation are...

### Film adaptation

I'm generally interested in **adaptation** and particularly in **film adaptation** and this provides a potentially intriguing perspective to come at that from. One, I like the thought that this framework of being a killer for hire at a cinema changes the gaze you have and the way you watch the film (you're distracted, but you're also killing time ha ha). Two, this could even be a kind of framing for some level of film criticism in the sense that the person who hired you can be talking to you during the film and that can drift into thoughts about the film itself as a way of drawing further attention to it. If you found the right film you could potentially get kind of meta by blurring the plot of the film and the plot of the game.

I have a (soon to be rejected no doubt) grant proposal in the works around film adaptation, so this also just fits into the proposed body of Real Official Work I have for the year. ROWing my way against the current.

### Edutainment

I think this is a really funny way to lead somebody into watching a film or at least being present at a film and I think there's plenty to play around with in terms of encouraging actual engagement with the film as well as that tension between the killer's attention and the cinemagoer's attention at work in the same person. I've enjoyed watching films in other games (*The Witness* notably, and *Airplane Mode*, and *THAT NIGHT, STEEPED BY BLOOD RIVER*, and little bits in *Chasing Light*).

So, yeah I suppose the major watchword here revolves around playing with the nature of the player's gaze/attention and the context of play in relation to the content of play or something. How do you watch a movie when you're contracted to kill someone else who's watching the movie?
