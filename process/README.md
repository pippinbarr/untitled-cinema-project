# Process documentation

I'm following a specific approach to game documentation called the Method for Design Materialization (MDM) developed as part of the [Games as Research](https://www.gamesasresearch.com/) project. Here are the pieces.

### [Why?](./why.md)

In which I attempt to write research-level justifications for what makes this project worth pursuing.

### [Process journal](./process-journal.md)

The heart and soul of the process documentation, wherein I write with anguish and occasional insight about what on earth I'm doing.

### [To do](./to-do.md)

Sometimes I remember this and sometimes I don't.

### [Commit history](https://github.com/pippinbarr/untitled-cinema-project/commits/main)

Central to the life of a project is its commit history on Git, the little messages that detail moment-to-moment development (and design) decisions as well as other additions to the official process documentation.
